<p>balloons is an 888-byte digital artwork consisting of a poem about the experience of ego death whilst under the influence of nitrous oxide/"laughing gas"</p>

<p>the poem is followed by sonic pi code which produces generative music to accompany the poem, processed with effects to simulate the auditory hallucinations caused by the nitrous oxide</p>

<p>its size is limited to 888 bytes so that it can be stored on an ntag216 NFC/RFID chip which has been implanted into the artist's left hand</p>

<p>poem &amp; code reproduced below, or download from <a href="https://adamjohnwilliams.github.io/art/ajw_balloons">https://adamjohnwilliams.github.io/art/ajw_balloons</a></p>

<p>use sonic pi to hear &amp; interact with the music <a href="https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi">https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi</a></p>

<p>performance video coming soon</p>

<pre><code>#And what if when, I turn to dust
#The earth collapses in around me
#Falling, shrinking down, compressing
#Passing to the other side

#And in that moment, movement ceases
#All is still, no time progresses
#Curtain up, expose the mechanism
#Hey, remember the balloons?
